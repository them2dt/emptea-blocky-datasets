# What is Blockchain?

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic concept of blockchain technology
- Learn about the key components of a blockchain
- Grasp the importance of decentralization

## Introduction
A blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Think of it as a digital chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block using cryptography.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Decentralization
Unlike traditional centralized systems where a single authority controls the data, blockchain distributes control across the network. This means:
- No single point of failure
- Greater transparency
- Reduced need for intermediaries

### 2. Immutability
Once data is recorded on the blockchain:
- It cannot be changed or deleted
- All history is preserved
- Creates trust through transparency

### 3. Consensus
Network participants must agree on the state of the ledger through:
- Consensus mechanisms (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake)
- Validation of transactions
- Synchronization across the network

## Real-World Applications
- Cryptocurrencies
- Supply chain tracking
- Digital identity management
- Smart contracts

## Summary
Blockchain technology provides a secure, transparent, and decentralized way to record transactions and data. Its unique properties make it suitable for various applications beyond just cryptocurrencies.
