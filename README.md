# Course Structure

The content is organized hierarchically:

## courses
At the highest level, content is divided into broad **courses** (e.g., Mathematics, Science, History).

## topics
Within each course, you'll find multiple **topics** that break down the course into focused areas of study (e.g., in Mathematics: Algebra, Geometry, Calculus).

## lessons
Each Topic contains individual **Lessons** - the actual learning content that covers specific concepts and skills (e.g., in Algebra: Linear Equations, Quadratic Functions, etc.).
