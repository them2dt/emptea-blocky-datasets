# Building Blocks of Blockchain

To understand how blockchain works, let's break down its core components and see how they fit together.

## Transactions
Transactions are the basic units of activity in a blockchain. They represent:
- Transfer of value or information between parties
- Changes to the blockchain's state
- Instructions for smart contracts
- Data records that need to be stored

Each transaction contains:
- Sender and recipient information
- The data or value being transferred
- Digital signatures to verify authenticity
- Timestamp of when it occurred

## Blocks
Blocks are containers that hold multiple transactions. Think of them as pages in a ledger, where each page contains multiple entries. A block typically includes:

1. **Block Header**:
   - Previous block's reference (hash)
   - Timestamp
   - Nonce (number used in mining)
   - Merkle root (summary of all transactions)

2. **Transaction List**:
   - All validated transactions during the block creation period
   - Organized in a specific order
   - Cryptographically secured

## Chains
The "chain" in blockchain comes from how blocks are connected. Each block:
- Contains a reference to the previous block
- Creates an unbreakable link through cryptographic hashes
- Forms a chronological sequence of information

This chaining mechanism ensures:
- Historical integrity
- Immutability of past records
- Transparent transaction history

## How They Work Together

1. **Transaction Creation**:
   - Users initiate transactions
   - Transactions are broadcast to the network
   - Network nodes validate the transactions

2. **Block Formation**:
   - Valid transactions are collected into a block
   - Miners/validators compete to create the next block
   - Block must meet network's consensus rules

3. **Chain Extension**:
   - New block is connected to previous block
   - Network validates the entire chain
   - All nodes update their copy of the ledger

This process creates a secure, transparent, and immutable record of all activities on the blockchain. Each component plays a crucial role:
- Transactions provide the data
- Blocks organize and secure the data
- Chains ensure historical integrity and order

Understanding these building blocks is essential for grasping how blockchain technology maintains security, transparency, and trust without central authority.
